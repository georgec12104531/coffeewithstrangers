              Tea Time is where five-ish strangers sit at a cafe with a Host
              to have a two hour conversation. It's not about anything in
              particular.
            </p>
            <p>
              You're meant to know pretty much nothing about the people that
              come, aside from the fact that they all signed up for this â€”
              just like you. It's self-selecting in that sense.
            </p>
            <p>However, it may bring you comfort to know a little something about your Host. If so, just keep reading</p>
